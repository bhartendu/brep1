my first git repository
As I'm a new to git repository. I dont know how stuff works here. I have made this public repo.
If anyone out there can start teaching me how to operate and work on git repos.
This repository was made for learning purpose. 
Interseted in learning python, php, django, cakephp, laravel, node.js, angular.js, reveal.js
and many more..

Thanks in advance.
